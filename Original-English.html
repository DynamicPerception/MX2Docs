  <h1 class="book-heading">Interacting with the Controller</h1>
  
<div class="post">          
            

<p>The MX2 is designed to be extremely simple to use, and to
 let you quickly input the most important parameters during a shoot.&nbsp; 
This document describes the means of interacting with the controller 
through the user interface, and how to use the main control screen.</p>
<h2>Buttons</h2>
<p>There are five pushbuttons, four  arranged in a cross-pattern, and  one to the lower left.&nbsp; The four  buttons together are <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Left]</span>,<span style="color: #3366ff;"> [Right]</span>, <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Up]</span> and <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Down]</span> while the button to the  lower left is the <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Enter]</span> button.</p>
<h3>Enter:</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Brings  up the main menu, or selects a menu item.
<ul>
 <li>If  item is another  menu, that menu will be opened, otherwise the 
value  selected will be  shown for editing, or executed depending on the
  currently selected  item.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 <li>Saves the current value being edited</li>
 <li>Exits  manual motor control</li>
</ul>
<h3>Up:</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Selects the  menu item directly above</li>
 <li>Increases the value of the currently  selected item</li>
 <li>Increases motor speed (manual motor control)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Down:</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Selects  the menu item directly below</li>
 <li>Decreases the value of the currently  selected item</li>
 <li>Decreases motor speed (manual motor control)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Left:</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Moves  input selection left (main screen only)</li>
 <li>Moves current motor  left (manual motor control)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Right:</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Moves  input selection right (main screen only)</li>
 <li>Cancels value input  (when changing the value of a selected item)</li>
 <li>Moves current motor  right (manual motor control)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Menus and Editing Values</h2>
<p>When on the Main Screen, pressing the Enter button  will  draw the main menu.&nbsp; Pressing <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Enter]</span>
 on any menu item will either draw  the  sub-menu selected or, if the 
item selected is an input, it will be   displayed for editing. When a 
value for editing is displayed, you may   use<span style="color: #3366ff;"> [Up] </span>and<span style="color: #3366ff;"> [Down]</span> to alter the value.&nbsp; If you wish to save the value,   simply press <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Enter]</span> again.&nbsp; To exit the editor without saving, press the <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Right]</span> button and the original value will be restored.&nbsp; The <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Right]</span>
 button also functions as the “back” button, allowing one to go   back 
one level from any menu, or return to the Main Screen from the   
top-level menu.</p>
<p>For some values that you can edit, a limited   selection of choices 
such as ‘Up/Down’, ‘On/Off’, ‘Left/Right’ may be   displayed.&nbsp; Pressing 
either <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Up]</span> or <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Down]</span>
 in the edit screen will alternate   between the available values.&nbsp; For 
some values, you may be allowed to   enter more or less than the value 
accepts — when saving in these cases   the value will be set at its 
minimum or maximum, and will reflect this   when next displayed.</p>
<p>To increase or decrease a number, you can   simply hold <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Up]</span> or <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Down]</span>
 to continue to increase or decrease the value for   as long as you hold
 it down.&nbsp; The longer the button is held, the  faster  it increases or 
decreases a value.&nbsp; In this manner, you may  easily  enter large 
numbers.</p>
<h2>Saving Input Values Permanently</h2>
<p>When editing certain values (such as RPM for a motor axis, interval  
time, etc.) they are automatically saved to permanent memory for you.&nbsp;  
In this way, you will not have to make the same changes between  
re-start.&nbsp; The values which are saved permanently are indicated in their
  appropriate documentation.&nbsp; To wipe out permanent memory, and reset to
  default values, choose the ‘Reset Mem’ option in the Main Settings  
menu.</p>
<p>Please note that direction and speed of a given axis are designed to 
be changed regularly, and are not saved to permanent memory.</p>
<h2>The Main Screen</h2>
<p>The Main Screen provides an overview  of the current status and also 
 allows for quick modification of key  operating parameters.&nbsp; This 
screen  has the following layout:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>
<tt>-----------------<br>
On 3s&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  [15]<br>
R30.50%&nbsp;&nbsp; L0.00%<br>
-----------------</tt></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
</p>
<p>On  the first line we have the current  status (On or Off), the  
intervalometer timing (3s), and a count of shots  fired since turned on 
 ([15]).&nbsp; The second line displays the direction  and speed for each  
motor, with motor 1 on the left, and motor 2 on the  right.</p>
<p>Pressing <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Right] </span>will advance 
through  the values that can be  changed directly from the main screen: 
status,  timing, direction and  speed of each motor.&nbsp; When a particular 
value is  displayed with a  flashing cursor on it, you can change the 
value using&nbsp;<span style="color: #3366ff;"> [Up]</span> and <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Down]</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
 <li>You  may change any value when the shoot is running — it will take effect  immediately.</li>
 <li>Motor speed can be displayed in either percentage  (%), 
inches-per-minute (i), or cm-per-minute (c) this is configurable in the 
Settings  menu.</li>
 <li>Pressing <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Left]</span> will back up one setting on the  screen</li>
 <li>Pressing <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Enter]</span> at any time when on the main screen will  bring up the Main Menu, even if program is running</li>
</ul>

  <h1 class="book-heading">Choosing the Speed Display</h1>
  
<div class="post">          
            

<p>With the MX2 controller, you can either display and input
 speeds in percentages of maximum (relative) or inches per minute 
(absolute).</p>
<p>The speed display setting is global, and impacts all axes.&nbsp; You may 
not configure one for relative and one for absolute speed display.</p>
<p>If you modify the speed for a given axis while the program is running, it will immediately take effect.</p>
<h2>Displaying in Relative Speeds (Percentage)</h2>
<p>When displaying in relative speeds, the main screen will show a 
floating-point number and the symbol ‘%’ on the speed value for the 
given motor.&nbsp; You may modify this value to any value between 0 and 100% 
as allowed by the motion control mode you are in by highlighting it 
using the <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Right]</span> button on the main screen and then using<span style="color: #3366ff;"> [Up]</span> and <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Down]</span> to change the value.</p>

</ol>
<h2>Displaying in Absolute Speeds (inches or cm)</h2>
<p>When displaying in absolute speeds, the main screen will show a  
floating-point number and the symbol ‘i’ (or ‘c’ if in metric mode) next
 to the the speed value for the  given motor.&nbsp; You may modify this value
 to any value as allowed by the motion control mode you are in by 
highlighting it using the<span style="color: #3366ff;"> [Right] </span>button on the main screen and then using <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Up]</span> and <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Down]</span> to change the value.</p>

<h2>Displaying in Metric Values</h2>
<p>The MX2 can shows absolute distances and speeds in centimeters.&nbsp; When you enable the <em>metric mode</em>
 parameter, all distance values stored in permanent memory are converted
 from inches to centimeters, and the display will show a ‘c’ on the main
 screen instead of ‘i’ for absolute speeds.</p>
<p>You should always re-start the MX2 after enabling the&nbsp; <em>metric mode</em> parameter.</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">Controlling the LCD Display</h1>
  <div class="post">          
            

<p>The MX2 controller comes with the ability to control the 
LCD display to reduce power consumption or light pollution onto your 
shots at night.&nbsp; The standard LCD for the MX2 is a 16×2 character black 
on green LCD display.&nbsp; This LCD can easily be read during bright 
daylight without the backlight on and at night with very little 
backlight.</p>
<h2>Adjusting the BackLight Brightness</h2>
<p>The backlight brightness can be dimmed by the MX2 firmware, but only when in <em>interleaved</em> motion mode.&nbsp; If you have turned on <em>continuous</em> motion mode, and run an axis below the defined <em>slow speed threshold</em>, the backlight dimmer will not work until the MX2 is re-started.&nbsp; When you have engaged in <em>continuous</em> motion at a speed under the <em>slow speed threshold</em>, the LCD will either be fully on or fully off depending on your LCD backlight settings.</p>
<p>You can set a value between 0 and 255 for the <em>backlight level</em>.&nbsp; If you enter a value larger than 255, it will automatically be limited to 255.</p>
<p>Like most values in the MX2 controller, the <em>backlight level</em> value is retained after power-off.</p>
<p><strong>Actions:</strong></p>
<ol>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Enter] </span>to enter the main menu</li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Down]</span> to select <strong>Settings</strong>and press <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Enter]</span></li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Down]</span> to select <strong>Backlight </strong>and press<span style="color: #3366ff;"> [Enter]</span></li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Up]</span> or<span style="color: #3366ff;"> [Down]</span> to adjust the backlight level value<strong></strong></li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Enter]</span> to save or <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Right]</span> to abort</li>
</ol>
<h2>Turning the LCD BackLight Off Automatically</h2>
<p>You may wish to have the backlight on while entering values, but then
 to turn off automatically a few seconds later to reduce the power drain
 on your batteries.&nbsp; You can configure the MX2 to turn off the backlight
 after a number of seconds of inactivity by adjusting the <em>auto dim</em> parameter.&nbsp; The backlight will turn back on the next time a button is pressed.</p>
<p>Enter the<em> auto dim</em> parameter value in seconds of inactivity 
before the backlight turns off, set it to zero if you wish to disable 
automatic dimming of the LCD backlight.</p>
<p>Like most values in the MX2 controller, the <em>auto dim</em> value is retained after power-off.</p>
<p><strong>Actions:</strong></p>
<ol>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Enter]</span> to enter the main menu</li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Down]</span> to select <strong>Settings</strong>and press<span style="color: #3366ff;"> [Enter]</span></li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Down] </span>to select <strong>AutoDim </strong>and press<span style="color: #3366ff;"> [Enter]</span></li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Up]</span> or<span style="color: #3366ff;"> [Down]</span> to adjust the auto dim value</li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Enter]</span> to save or<span style="color: #3366ff;"> [Right]</span> to abort</li>
</ol>
<h2>Disabling the Entire LCD Automatically</h2>
<p>To save as much power as possible, the MX2 can completely disable the
 LCD, turning off the text in addition to the backlight.&nbsp; To enable this
 feature, enable the <em>blank lcd</em> parameter in addition to setting an <em>auto dim</em> time.&nbsp; When <em>blank lcd</em> is enabled, the LCD is turned off entirely after the number of seconds specified in the <em>auto dim </em>parameter value pass with no input via the buttons.</p>
<p>After the LCD has been blanked, the first button you press will 
simply re-enable the LCD to allow you to verify where you were on the 
screen before submitting a button press and taking an unknown action.</p>
<p>Like most values in the MX2 controller, the<em> blank lcd </em> value is retained after power-off.</p>
<p><strong>Actions:</strong></p>
<ol>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Enter]</span> to enter the main menu</li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Down]</span> to select <strong>Settings</strong>and press <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Enter]</span></li>

  <h1 class="book-heading">Configuring Camera Control</h1>
  
<div class="post">          
            

<p>The MX2 controller provides direct control of a camera 
through a cable connected to the remote release port of your camera.&nbsp; On
 most cameras, there are two primary functions provided: Control Shutter
 and Control Auto Focus.&nbsp; Here we’ll describe how to set up the MX2 to 
handle different shooting requirements.</p>
<p>Remember that for the camera to be controlled by the MX2, the camera 
must be connected through its remote shutter port to the MX2 Camera port
 using an appropriate cable.&nbsp; For some cameras, it may be required to 
put the camera in Remote Control mode to recognize the signals from the 
remote shutter port.</p>
<p>All parameters indicated below are saved when the power is removed 
from the MX2, and only need to be modified when you want to change them.</p>
<h2>Setting the Exposure Interval</h2>
<p>The <em>exposure interval</em> is the time between each exposure.&nbsp; 
This value is displayed on the Main Screen, and may be set in tenths of 
seconds (e.g. 0.2″, 1.1″, and so forth).&nbsp; It can be edited directly on 
the main screen, or through the Camera Menu.</p>
<p>Note that the <em>exposure interval</em> is the time between <em>triggering</em>
 each exposure, and not necessarily the time between completing one 
exposure and starting the next.&nbsp; The different camera delays you 
configure, for focus tapping, exposure delay, etc. will impact your 
actual <em>exposure interval</em> time, should they be longer than the 
interval when summed.&nbsp; In the case where your parameters have caused the
 interval time to be exceeded, the main screen will always display the <em>actual</em>
 interval time, and not the time you configured.&nbsp; It will not be 
possible to reduce the interval without first decreasing one of the 
other camera delays you have configured.</p>
<p>If you change the <em>exposure interval</em> while the program is running, it will take effect on the next exposure cycle.</p>
<p>Like most values in the MX2 controller, the <em>Exposure Interval</em> value is retained after power-off.</p>
<p><strong>Setting the Exposure Interval via the Main Screen</strong>:</p>
<ol>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Right]</span> or <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Left]</span> to select the displayed interval time</li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Up]</span> or <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Down]</span> to modify the value</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Setting the Exposure Interval via the Camera Menu:</strong></p>
<ol>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Enter]</span> to enter the main menu</li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Down]</span> to select<strong>Camera</strong>and press<span style="color: #3366ff;"> [Enter]</span></li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Down]</span> to select <strong>Interval </strong>and press <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Enter]</span></li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Up]</span> or<span style="color: #3366ff;"> [Down]</span> to alter the value</li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Enter]</span> to save or<span style="color: #3366ff;"> [Right]</span> to abort</li>
</ol>
<h2>Controlling Exposure Time with the MX2</h2>
<p>The MX2 controller is capable of doing bulb exposure control.&nbsp; The shutter line will be kept engaged for as long as the <em>exposure time</em>
 parameter is configured for.&nbsp;&nbsp; The exposure time is entered in 
milliseconds, and may be set for as low as your camera will recognize, 
or up to about 50 days.&nbsp; Remember that there are one thousand 
milliseconds in a second, so if you want a one second exposure, it would
 be entered as <em>1000</em>.</p>
<p>Please note that different cameras have different <em>exposure time</em>
 requirements for bulb mode, both minimum and maximum time.&nbsp; If you need
 a controlled exposure for a shorter period of time than your camera 
will allow in bulb mode, you must use the camera to control the exposure
 in using its manual mode.&nbsp; You may need to experiment to discover the 
correct minimums and maximums for your particular camera.</p>
<p><strong>Actions:</strong></p>
<ol>
 <li>Set camera to bulb (B) mode</li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Enter]</span> to enter the main menu</li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Down]</span> to select <strong>Camera</strong>and press <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Enter]</span></li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Down]</span> to select <strong>Exp. Time </strong>and press<span style="color: #3366ff;"> [Enter]</span></li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Up]</span> or <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Down]</span> to alter the value</li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Enter]</span> to save or<span style="color: #3366ff;"> [Right] </span>to abort</li>

 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Enter]</span> to save or<span style="color: #3366ff;"> [Right]</span> to abort</li>
</ol>
<h2>Controlling Exposure Time on the Camera</h2>
<p>For most cases, you’ll find it best to control the exposure on the 
camera, using manual, or some other mode to dial in the appropriate 
exposure time.&nbsp; Under certain conditions it will be important to tell 
the MX2 the actual exposure time you’ve dialed in on the camera, so that
 it does not attempt to trigger an exposure at the wrong time.&nbsp; The 
amount of time to wait after triggering an exposure is configured via 
the <em>exposure delay</em> value.&nbsp; This value is input in milliseconds, so one second would be entered as <em>1000</em>.</p>
<p>To disable any delay after triggering an exposure, set the <em>exposure delay </em>value to zero.</p>
<p>For <em>continuous motion</em> control, it is generally not necessary to set an exact <em>exposure delay</em> in the MX2 unless it exceeds your configured interval time.&nbsp; However, for <em>interleaved</em>,
 or shoot-move-shoot, motion control, it is essential to dial in the 
correct exposure time to prevent motor movement during the exposure.&nbsp; In
 many cases, it is advantageous to exceed the actual exposure time 
configured on the camera in the <em>exposure delay</em> parameter.</p>
<p>Additionally, you should configure the <em>exposure time</em> to its minimal value to prevent unnecessary delays.&nbsp; Each camera may have a different minimum <em>exposure time</em> required to honor the request to trip the shutter.&nbsp; For many cameras 100mS is a safe bet.</p>
<p><em>Exposure time</em> must <strong>always be greater than zero</strong> to trigger the camera.</p>

<h2>Limiting the Number of Frames Taken</h2>
<p>The MX2 can automatically stop running when a certain number of frames have been exposed.&nbsp; Simply set the <em>max shots</em> parameter for the camera.</p>
<p>Note that when ramping/feathering moves, setting the <em>max shots</em> parameter tells the MX2 when to start ramping down.</p>
<p>Like most values in the MX2 controller, the <em>Max Shots</em> value is retained after power-off.</p>

</ol>
<h2>Auto-Focus, Waking the Camera from Sleep, and Shooting in Live View</h2>
<p>For certain conditions, the focus control line can be used to control other aspects of the camera:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Trip auto-focus before firing</li>
 <li>On long interval times, put the camera into auto-sleep mode and use the focus line to wake it up before firing</li>
 <li>For some live-view cameras, the camera may not respond to the first 
time the exposure is tripped unless the focus line is tripped first</li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>focus tap</em> parameter allows you to define how long the 
focus line should be triggered before the exposure line is triggered.&nbsp; 
This time is input in milliseconds, and there will always be an 
additional 1/10th second (100mS) delay after disengaging the focus line 
before the exposure line will engage to prevent a bouncing effect being 
perceived by the camera.</p>
<p>It is important to set this value to the right amount required for 
your particular camera configuration.&nbsp; Some cameras focus slower than 
others, or require more time to wake up than others, and will require 
that the<em> focus tap</em> value be much higher.&nbsp; Experiment with your camera and shooting conditions to determine which works best for you.</p>
<p>To disable the focus tap functionality, set the time to zero (0) milliseconds.</p>
<p>Like most values in the MX2 controller, the <em>Focus Tap Time</em> value is retained after power-off.</p>

<h2>Cameras that Require Focus with Shutter (many Nikons)</h2>
<p>The MX2 is capable of controlling cameras that require that the focus
 line be triggered along with the shutter line to trigger an exposure.&nbsp; 
Many Nikon cameras require this, and some Canon users also report that 
their cameras respond more reliably when the two lines are triggered 
together.&nbsp; The <em>shutter-focus</em> parameter allows you to control this behavior.</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">Choosing Your Motion Mode</h1>
  
<div class="post">          
            

<p>The two basic motion control modes for the MX2 controller are <em>Continuous Motion</em> and <em>Interleaved</em>. (Also known as <em>Shoot-Move-Shoot</em>.)&nbsp;&nbsp;
 In Continuous Motion mode, the motor moves irrespective of the camera 
being fired, and generally at a consistent speed.&nbsp; In Interleaved mode, 
the motor only moves between exposures.&nbsp; These two motion control modes 
can result in different aesthetics in your output video, and each are 
best geared to a specific type of shooting.&nbsp; The following table will 
help to summarize the best way to choose between the two motion types 
based on the parameters of your shot, or the effect you wish to achieve:</p>

<p>Now, many photographers will use a particular mode more often than 
another, as a matter of taste or artistic intent.&nbsp; While the table above
 attempts to serve as a guide to when to choose between the modes, your 
workflow or shooting style may call for a specified mode that is in 
contradiction with the table.&nbsp; Every one is unique, and their style is 
their own — you should practice with each mode and understand which is 
right for you.</p>
<p>You may only choose one motion type at a time, it is not possible to run one axis in <em>continuous motion</em> and another in <em>interleaved</em>.</p>
<h2>Using Continuous Motion</h2>
<p>The default behavior of the MX2 controller is to operate in <em>continuous motion</em> mode.&nbsp; For the highest end of the speed range, the control acts as a basic <em>Pulse Width Modulation</em>
 driver, varying the speed of the motor by changing the frequency at 
which voltage is applied to it.&nbsp; However, once the speed falls below the
 configured slow speed floor, a special “pulsing” mode kicks in.&nbsp; In <em>pulsing</em>
 mode, the motor is run at full speed for a brief period of time, 
usually on the order of milliseconds, and then shut down for a period of
 time.&nbsp; This causes the motor to operate at full torque at absolute 
minimum speeds.&nbsp; While the motor is only moving part of the time, the 
measured average speed over a period of time should largely approximate 
the inches per minute (or percentage of speed) specified.</p>
<p>In all <em>continuous motion</em> modes, you are able to choose from 
any one of 255 different speeds, from completely stopped to moving at 
full speed.&nbsp; As each change to the speed is a 1/255th speed change, 
speeds will appear to make larger jumps when being entered on the main 
screen than you might expect.</p>
<p>At the very slowest speeds, it is generally preferable to move to <em>interleaved</em> mode, because the added vibration of the long pulses on the motor.</p>

 <li>[Enter] to save or <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Right] </span>to abort</li>
</ol>
<h2>Using Interleaved Motion</h2>
<p>There are two types of <em>interleaved</em> motion control available on the MX2: <em>Calculated</em> and <em>Fixed</em>.</p>
<h3>Calculated Interleave Mode</h3>
<p>In <em>calculated</em> mode, you input the distance moved in actual 
speed (inches or cm per minute), and the distance moved between each 
shot is determined based off of the <em>exposure interval</em> you 
input.&nbsp; For example, if you input 1 inch per minute as your speed, and 
your interval is set to 1 second, the axis would move 1/60th of an inch 
between each shot.&nbsp; This mode is used when you want to easily determine 
how fast you want to move from one point to another on the axis, and 
generally requires little forethought to set up a shot.</p>
<p>You may input values from 1/100th of an inch (or cm if in metric mode) to the maximum distance the motor can move in one minute.</p>
<p>To enable <em>Calculated Interleave</em> Mode:</p>

</ol>
<h3>Fixed Interleave Mode</h3>
<p>In <em>fixed</em> mode, you input the distance moved as <em>actual distance traveled</em>
 between each exposure.&nbsp; You may input values from 1/100th of an inch 
(or cm if in metric mode) to the maximum distance the motor can move in 
one minute.&nbsp; This mode is used when you want to accurately dial-in 
distances moved between exposures, or achieve very smooth ramp (feather)
 transitions.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is generally the preferred motion control method 
for extreme close-up shots and anything using a long telephoto lens to 
both prevent vibration during exposure and the accurately define motion 
from frame to frame.</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">Ramping or Feathering Into Moves</h1>
  
<div class="post">          
            

<p>The MX2 controller can “feather” or ramp into and out of 
moves causing moves to start slowly and get faster within the video, 
providing a nice accelerating or decelerating effect.&nbsp; It does this by 
altering the distance moved between shots, or the speed moved, starting 
with no speed and ramping up to your desired speed over a configurable 
number of frames.&nbsp; Additionally, a lead-in or lead-out can be used to 
add a static period before or after a motor’s movements, adding to your 
ability to create the shot you want.</p>
<p>Ramp settings for a particular axis are saved between power-off cycles.</p>
<h2>Configuring Ramping</h2>
<p>A ramp into or out of a movement is done by changing the speed or 
distance moved based on the number of frames that have been exposed.&nbsp; 
For example, I can set the <em>ramp value</em> for an axis to 24 frames,
 and at 24FPS output video it would take one second for the motion in 
the output video to come to full speed.&nbsp; This is achieved by starting 
the motor at no speed, and then increasing the speed just enough to 
match the desired output speed at the right interval to reach full speed
 at the desired frame as specified in the ramp value.</p>
<p>If you also configure the <em>max shots</em> parameter for the camera, the MX2 will automatically ramp down the motor to zero speed so that motion completes when the <em>max shots</em> count is reached.&nbsp; See <a href="http://dynamicperception.com/content/configuring-camera-control">Configuring Camera Control</a> <span class="print-footnote">[1]</span>.</p>
<p>Note that in <em>continuous motion</em> mode, you only have 255 speed
 increments available, this means that ramps into low speeds (1-10% of 
maximum speed) can be rough.&nbsp; To get extremely smooth ramps, it’s best 
to choose <em>fixed interleave</em> mode.&nbsp; See <a href="http://dynamicperception.com/content/choosing-your-motion-mode">Choosing Your Motion Mode</a> <span class="print-footnote">[2]</span> for more information.</p>
<p>To understand how ramping will affect your output video, take the following parameter values:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Output video = 24 frames per second</li>
 <li>Max shots = 240 (10 seconds)</li>
 <li>Ramp rate = 24</li>
 <li>Axis speed = 1 inch per minute</li>
</ul>
<p>The following will happen in the output video:</p>
<ul>
 <li>For one second, the motion will accelerate to full speed</li>
 <li>For eight seconds, the motion will run at full speed (1 IPM)</li>
 <li>For one second, the motor will decelerate to no speed</li>
</ul>
<p>This illustrates how ramping is achieved and the end result in your output video.</p>
<p>The <em>ramp value</em> for each axis is controlled independently.</p>
<p><strong>Actions:</strong></p>
<ol>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Enter]</span> to enter the main menu</li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Down] </span>to select <strong>Axis </strong><em><strong>x</strong> </em>and press <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Enter]</span></li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Down]</span> to select <strong>Ramp </strong>and press<span style="color: #3366ff;"> [Enter]</span></li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Up]</span> or<span style="color: #3366ff;"> [Down]</span> to input the number of frames to reach full speed</li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Enter]</span> to save or<span style="color: #3366ff;"> [Right]</span> to abort without saving</li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Right]</span> to return to the main menu</li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Right]</span> to return to the main screen</li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Right]</span> as many times needed to select the desired axis speed</li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Up]</span> and <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Down]</span> to adjust the desired speed</li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Left] </span>to the On/Off control</li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Up] </span>to start the program running</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the program starts running, the speed will set its self to zero 
for any axis with a ramp value configured.&nbsp; If you stop the program 
running before it reaches full speed, it will now see the current speed 
as the desired speed, and you will have to increase it back to your 
original value.</p>
<h2>Using a Lead-in or Lead-out</h2>
<p>A <em>lead-in</em> defines a period of time, in frames from the beginning of the shoot, that the motor should not move.&nbsp; Conversely, a <em>lead-out</em>
 defines the period of time from the end of the shoot that the motor 
should not move.&nbsp; Each axis can have its own lead-in and lead-out times 
defined — however, to function, a <em>ramp value</em> must be set for 
that axis as well.&nbsp; Leads are executed through the ramping/feathering 
function of the controller, by simply preventing it from starting a ramp
 before a certain number of frames have passed (in the case of a 
lead-in), or reducing the overall number of frames counted before 
ramping all the way down to zero (in the case of a lead-out).</p>
<p>As with ramping/feathering, a lead-out is only used if the <em>max shots</em> parameter has been set, and therefor the controller can determine when to start reducing speed.</p>
<p>To help clarify this function, we’ll use the same parameters from the ramping example, and add a lead-in and lead-out:</p>
<p>take the following parameter values:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Output video = 24 frames per second</li>
 <li>Max shots = 240 (10 seconds)</li>
 <li>Ramp rate = 24</li>
 <li>Lead-in = 24</li>
 <li>Lead-out = 24</li>
 <li>Axis speed = 1 inch per minute</li>
</ul>
<p>The following will happen in the output video:</p>
<ul>
 <li>For one second, no movement will occur</li>
 <li>For one second, the motion will accelerate to full speed</li>
 <li>For seconds seconds, the motion will run at full speed (1 IPM)</li>
 <li>For one second, the motor will decelerate to no speed</li>
 <li>For one second, no movement will occur</li>
</ul>

  <h1 class="book-heading">Calibrating the Controller</h1>
  
<div class="post">          
            

<p>The MX2 controller comes pre-calibrated for a load of 
approximately 1.5kg (~ 3.5 lbs).  This is the weight of a medium sized 
dSLR, zoom lens, and small ball head.</p>
<p>Calibrating is not essential to make use of the MX2 with the Stage 
Zero Dolly for timelapse use, however it can greatly increase the 
accuracy of specific distances you dial in when entering values in 
inches per minute.  As the Stage Zero dolly’s motor does not have 
feedback to the controller, the controller can only tell the motor to 
move at certain speeds and at certain times.  Calibrating the controller
 allows you to adjust the controller for variations in how the motor 
behaves under different loads and at different speeds.</p>
<p>Calibration of the motor is saved when the MX2 is powered off, so you
 only need to re-calibrate when your payload (camera/lens/head/etc.) 
changes in weight significantly.&nbsp; If you swap out motors or pulleys, it 
is important to perform a calibration as well, after adjusting the motor
 parameters to match your new combination.</p>
<p><em>Please note that it is impossible for the MX2 to make all speeds 
accurate at all times.&nbsp; The calibration routine will allow you to 
dial-in one or two specific speeds more accurately than others, but as a
 low-cost system, perfect accuracy is not achievable.</em></p>
<h2>Adjusting the Angle of the Dolly</h2>
<p>When operating the dolly at an angle, and using Inches Per Minute 
(IPM) speed input, you will want to inform the controller of the nearest
 angle of the track so that it can adjust based on the calibration for 
that angle.&nbsp; You may set the angle of the dolly (or any other linear 
axis) in the Axis Configuration menu for the given axis.&nbsp;&nbsp; Three angle 
values are possible: <em>0, 45,</em> and <em>90</em>.&nbsp; The <em>0</em> degree angle corresponds to the dolly being largely in parallel to the ground, <em>45</em> degrees corresponds to the track being at a 45-degree angle to the ground, and <em>90</em>
 degrees to being perpendicular to the ground.&nbsp; You should pick the 
angle closest to the one you are at, and when in doubt, err on the side 
of setting the angle higher.</p>
<p><strong>Actions:</strong></p>
<ol>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Enter]</span> to enter the main menu</li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Down]</span> to select <strong>Axis </strong><em><strong>x</strong> </em>and press <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Enter]</span></li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Down]</span> to select <strong>Angle </strong>and press <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Enter]</span></li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Up]</span> or<span style="color: #3366ff;"> [Down]</span> and choose between <em>0, 45, </em>and<em> 90</em></li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Enter] </span>to save or<span style="color: #3366ff;"> [Right]</span> to abort</li>
</ol>
<h2>Using Automatic Calibration</h2>
<p>Automatic calibration mode adjusts the assumptions the controller 
makes about the motor’s performance.&nbsp; By moving at different speeds, in 
different modes, and in different directions the controller expects the 
cart to have moved a certain distance.&nbsp; During automatic calibration, 
you will measure the distance the cart has moved at each stage, and in 
doing so the controller will automatically adjust its expectations of 
the motor’s performance at critical speeds.</p>
<p>You may calibrate the controller for each of the specified angles: <em>0, 45,</em> and <em>90</em>
 degrees.&nbsp; Each angle must be calibrated separately, but each time you 
calibrate, the calibration will be saved and you will not have to repeat
 it unless your payload substantially changes, or you change out the 
motor or main drive pulley.</p>
<p>To use automatic calibration, first move the dolly to the middle of 
the track, either through manual motor control or by loosening the belt 
and moving it by hand and then make sure that the belt is tightened 
fully before beginning. &nbsp; Now, place a ruler flat on the track in a 
position where neither the angle mounts nor the stabilizer bar will hit 
it, and line the edge of the ruler up with one of the edges of the 
cart.&nbsp; The cart will be moving to the right at first, so let the ruler 
stick out in that direction.&nbsp; For 45 degree and higher angles, it is 
worthwhile to tape down the ruler.</p>
<p>After selecting the angle you want to calibrate for and pressing <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Enter]</span>,
 the cart will first move quickly to the right, and ask you to enter how
 far it went in hundredths of an inch.&nbsp; (Don’t worry, just getting it 
close enough in tenths is good enough for most uses.)&nbsp; Enter the value 
using the up and down arrow keys and press enter to move to the next 
step.&nbsp; The cart will then move to the left and repeat the process, 
before going into two pulsing mode speed tests.&nbsp; The entire process 
should take around 3-4 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Actions:</strong></p>
<ol>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Enter]</span> to enter the main menu</li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Down]</span> to select <strong>Axis </strong><em><strong>x</strong> </em>and press<span style="color: #3366ff;"> [Enter]</span></li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Down] </span>to select <strong>Calibrate </strong>and press<span style="color: #3366ff;"> [Enter]</span></li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Up]</span> or<span style="color: #3366ff;"> [Down]</span> and choose between <em>0, 45, </em>and<em> 90 </em>degree calibration modes</li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Enter]</span> to start the calibration process, or<span style="color: #3366ff;"> [Right]</span> to exit without calibrating</li>
 <li>After the move is completed, use <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Up]</span> and <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Down]</span> to input the distance moved in inches</li>
 <li>Press <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Enter]</span> to save the value you input and repeat five more times</li>
 <li>After all calibration steps have been completed, use <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Right]</span> to exit the calibration screen</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
 <li>After a new calibration, you will need to adjust the <em>Calibration Constant Value</em>, which is documented below to finely tune in the calibration</li>
 <li>If you are using your own motor/gear chain with the MX2, and the 
calibration does not appear to move at all, adjust the low and high 
speed targets as indicated below</li>
</ul>
<h2>Adjusting Calibration</h2>
<p>The MX2′s calibration routine attempts to determine how much to 
adjust the on time of the motor based on its performance at default 
values.&nbsp; However, most motors behave non-linearly when adjusting their 
speed by changing the on time.&nbsp; This means that simply adjusting the 
on/off time alone is not enough to accurately dial in a speed that was 
off from the expected target.&nbsp; Usually, it results in the motor going 
much slower than expected for low speeds, as the non-linearity of the 
motor’s behavior increases at the lowest speeds.</p>
<p>To compensate for this, a <em>calibration constant</em> was 
introduced in the 0.83 version of the MX2 firmware.&nbsp; This allows you to 
configure how much of the calibration change is actually applied during 
run time calculations.&nbsp; Generally speaking, if the motor still runs too 
slow after calibration, the constant should be reduced, and if it runs 
too fast the constant should be increased.</p>
<p>The workflow for finely tuning in a particular speed is as follows:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Set either the low or high speed target to the desired speed (see below)</li>
 <li>Run the auto calibration</li>
 <li>Set <em>max shots</em> to 60</li>
 <li>Set <em>interval</em> to 1, disable all focus and post-exposure delays</li>
 <li>Set the desired axis to the desired angle</li>
 <li>Set the desired axis to the desired continuous speed on the main screen</li>
 <li>Turn the program on, and measure actual distance traveled</li>
 <li>Adjust calibration constant</li>
 <li>Repeat 7-8 until the speed is tightly dialed-in</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Actions:</strong></p>
<ol>
 <li><span style="color: #0000ff;">[Enter]</span> to enter the main menu</li>
 <li><span style="color: #0000ff;">[Down]</span> to select <strong>Axis </strong><em><strong>x</strong> </em>and press<span style="color: #0000ff;"> [Enter]</span></li>
 <li><span style="color: #0000ff;">[Down]</span> to select <strong>Cal. Constant </strong>and press <span style="color: #0000ff;">[Enter]</span></li>
 <li><span style="color: #0000ff;">[Up] </span>or <span style="color: #0000ff;">[Down]</span> and adjust the value as desired</li>
 <li><span style="color: #0000ff;">[Enter]</span> to save the value, or <span style="color: #0000ff;">[Right]</span> to exit without saving</li>
</ol>
<h2>Setting the Calibration Targets</h2>
<p>When you want to dial-in one or two speeds to be your most accurate, 
you should choose the speeds you use most.&nbsp; To adjust the speeds used in
 calibration, you will need to adjust the low and <em>high calibration targets</em> to the speeds you desire.</p>
<p>These values are set in the <em>Main Settings</em> menu.</p>
<p><strong>Actions:</strong></p>
<ol>
 <li><span style="color: #0000ff;">[Enter]</span> to enter the main menu</li>
 <li><span style="color: #0000ff;">[Down]</span> to select <strong>Settings</strong>and press <span style="color: #0000ff;">[Enter]</span></li>
 <li><span style="color: #0000ff;">[Down]</span> to select <strong>Cal. Spd. Low </strong>or <strong>Cal Spd. Hi </strong>and press <span style="color: #0000ff;">[Enter]</span></li>
 <li><span style="color: #0000ff;">[Up]</span> or <span style="color: #0000ff;">[Down]</span> and choose the target speed</li>
 <li><span style="color: #0000ff;">[Enter]</span> to save the new value</li>
 <li>Repeat calibration process as indicated above</li>
</ol>
<p>Like most values in the MX2 controller, the <em>Calibration Speed Targets</em> are retained after power-off.</p>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
 <li>The Low speed target <em>must</em> be lower than the High speed target</li>
 <li>You must re-calibrate after changing the targets</li>
</ul>
<h2>Adjusting for Very Heavy Weights or Weak Motors</h2>
<p>If you’re using the Stage Zero with a large camera/motion control 
payload, or are using the MX2 with a DIY rig with a smaller motor, you 
may need to adjust the minimum pulse time to give the motor enough time 
to get the cart moving at the lowest speeds.&nbsp;&nbsp; A larger minimum pulse 
time can make movements at low speeds rougher, so you generally want to 
keep it as low as possible, while still being able to start moving the 
cart forward at the lowest speed.</p>
<p>Like most values in the MX2 controller, the Minimum Pulse value is retained after power-off.</p>
<p><strong>Actions:</strong></p>
<ol>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Enter]</span> to enter the main menu</li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Down]</span> to select <strong>Axis </strong><em><strong>x</strong> </em>and press <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Enter]</span></li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Down]</span> to select <strong>Min Pulse </strong>and press<span style="color: #3366ff;"> [Enter]</span></li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Up]</span> and<span style="color: #3366ff;"> [Down]</span> to adjust the minimum pulse time</li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Enter]</span> to save or<span style="color: #3366ff;"> [Right] </span>to exit without saving</li>

  <h1 class="book-heading">Shooting Stop-Motion Films</h1>
  <div class="post">          
            

<p>Stop-Motion and Timelapse have slightly a different 
workflow, namely in that in timelapse you want your exposures to 
continue uninterrupted, on your set interval, for a period of time.&nbsp; 
Whereas, in stop-motion filming, you want to control when each exposure 
occurs so that you may make set adjustments or take other actions 
between exposures.&nbsp; The MX2 supports both of these workflows easily.</p>
<h2>Enabling Manual Triggering of Exposure and Motion</h2>
<p>In stop-motion, we want to take one exposure and make one move 
at-will, and have plenty of time to do what we need to do between 
exposures.&nbsp; To achieve this, we’ll cause the MX2 to abort its program 
after a single shot, and we’ll used <a href="http://dynamicperception.com/index.php?main_page=wordpress&amp;page_id=216"><em>Fixed Interleave</em> motion control</a> <span class="print-footnote">[3]</span> to establish our exact distance moved between shots.&nbsp; If we set the <em>maximum shot count</em>
 to 1 for the camera, when the MX2 is told to to turn motion on, it will
 expose one frame make its required move and stop until it is turned on 
again.</p>
<p><strong>Actions:</strong></p>
<ol>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Enter]</span> to enter the main menu</li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Down]</span> to select <strong>Camera</strong>and press<span style="color: #3366ff;"> [Enter]</span></li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Down]</span> to select <strong>Max Shots </strong>and press<span style="color: #3366ff;"> [Enter]</span></li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Up]</span> or <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Down]</span> and input a value of <strong><em>1</em></strong></li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Enter] </span>to save or<span style="color: #3366ff;"> [Right]</span> to abort</li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Right]</span> to return to the main menu</li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Right]</span> to return to the home screen</li>
</ol>
<p>You should also be in the <a href="http://dynamicperception.com/index.php?main_page=wordpress&amp;page_id=216"><em>Fixed Interleave</em></a> <span class="print-footnote">[3]</span> motion mode before beginning.&nbsp; On the main screen, input the desired distance to be moved between each shot, and then use <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Left]</span> to bring the cursor back to the <em>On/Off </em>value.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pressing <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Up]</span>
 will cause the MX2 to start running, fire a single shot, move, and then
 stop running.&nbsp; To fire the next frame, simply press <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Up]</span> again, and so forth.</p>
<p>If need be, you may also fashion a remote switch, connected to port <em>Ext 1</em>,&nbsp; and use this as a remote trigger to start the next exposure cycle.&nbsp; For more information see <a href="http://dynamicperception.com/index.php?main_page=wordpress&amp;page_id=284">Using Remote Inputs</a> <span class="print-footnote">[4]</span>.</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">Setting Motor and Drive Parameters</h1>
  
<div class="post">          
            

<p>Most of the motor parameters in the MX2 will never need 
to be modified if you are using the Stage Zero dolly in the stock 
configuration.&nbsp; These parameters are largely designed to adjust distance
 values listed on the main screen when you input movement in inches per 
minute.</p>
<p>The MX2 controller displays inches per minute for linear axes by 
relating the maximum RPM of the motor to the distance traveled by the 
final drive gear.&nbsp; If you’re using a pulley or gear as a final output 
drive (such as for a belt-driven system like the Stage Zero, or a 
rack-and-pinion driven system), the distance traveled is generally the 
pitch circumference of the gear.&nbsp; As these values effect the displayed 
distances for movements, you should only adjust them when changing 
something in the drivetrain.&nbsp; For calibrating different performance 
under different loads, you should <a href="http://dynamicperception.com/index.php?main_page=wordpress&amp;page_id=208">calibrate the axis</a> <span class="print-footnote">[5]</span> instead.</p>
<h2>Setting Motor RPM</h2>
<p>This setting allows you to input the Revolutions Per Minute of the 
motor you are controlling.&nbsp; This aids in determining the max speed of 
the motor.&nbsp; If you have multiple gear transitions after the motor its 
self, make sure to account for them in the RPM.&nbsp; For example, if you 
have a 2:1 transition from the motor output shaft to your drive gear, 
you would reduce RPM by one half.</p>
<p>Do not use this setting to adjust performance of the motor under load!&nbsp; <a href="http://dynamicperception.com/index.php?main_page=wordpress&amp;page_id=208">Calibrate the axis</a> <span class="print-footnote">[5]</span> instead.</p>
<p>Like most settings, the value is stored when powering off, and only needs to be changed when you change motors.</p>

</ol>
<h2>Setting Output Drive Distance</h2>
<p>To allow you to enter speeds and distances in actual distance, versus
 percentages, the MX2 must be aware of the actual distance moved per 
revolution of the motor.&nbsp; For most linear axes, the actual distance 
traveled will be based on the pitch circumference of the final output 
gear — for example: the pitch circumference of a drive pulley or the 
pitch circumference of a pinion on a rack-and-pinion drive.</p>
<p>Like most settings, the value is stored when powering off, and only needs to be changed when you change motors.</p>

<p>Sometimes it happens to the best of us: we get a little 
carried away and then we have no idea what setting we messed up, or how,
 and we just want to get everything back to where we started.&nbsp; The MX2 
saves most of the values you enter into permanent memory, reducing the 
amount of data entry you have to do for subsequent shoots, and letting 
you store calibration and so forth.&nbsp; There is a factory reset option 
which resets this permanent memory to its default state so that you can 
wipe all changes clean.</p>
<p>Resetting the permanent memory requires a restart of the MX2 
controller, and it may take longer than normal to restart the first time
 after resetting the memory.</p>
<p>You should always reset the permanent memory after doing any firmware
 upgrade.&nbsp; Retaining memory after an upgrade can result in some values 
that cannot be modified.</p>
<h2>Resetting Stored Memory to Defaults</h2>
<p>To reset the permanent memory on the MX2, you will need to first enable the <em>factory reset</em> parameter, and then restart the MX2.</p>

In this section of the guide, we will cover advanced usage for more 
experienced users or people wishing to modify or integrate their MX2 
with other devices.


  <div id="node-51" class="section-3">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Using Remote Inputs and Outputs</h1>
  
<div class="post">          
            

<p>The MX2 can be controlled remotely, much like it controls the camera, by using <em>Ext 1</em> inputs.&nbsp; On the left side of the MX2 controller there are two 2.5mm TRS plugs labeled <em>Ext 0</em> and <em>Ext 1</em>.&nbsp;
 Each of these plugs breaks out into two I/O lines and one ground line, 
which is essential for establishing communication between two electronic
 components.</p>
<p>The <em>Ext 0</em> inputs connect directly to the Arduino 
microcontroller’s hardware serial pins (Digital 1 is the tip connector, 
Digital 0 is the ring connector), and are reserved for special uses or 
serial communication.&nbsp; The <em>Ext 1</em> inputs, however, are general purpose inputs for use in controlling the MX2 and interacting with the environment.</p>
<p>Before we go any further, when we refer to a TRS connector and its 
“tip,” “ring,” or “sleeve,” the following image describes which 
conductor in the connector we’re referring to:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0pt none;" title="TRS connector" src="35_files/trs-connector.png" alt="" width="400" height="264"></p>
<p>To craft your own connection to a switch, or some other device, you 
will normally either buy a cable with a 2.5mm TRS connector on one end 
and bare leads on the other, or buy a 2.5mm TRS to 2.5mm TRS cable and 
cut one end off.&nbsp; Either way, make sure you accurately identify which 
wire matches which conductor — this is a simple task that be 
accomplished simply by using a multi-meter in “continuity” mode.&nbsp; This 
mode tells you whether or not two test points are electrically 
connected, in many electronic multi-meters there is an audible “beep” 
when the two points are connected.&nbsp; Simply test every wire in the cable 
against each conductor and label each wire as you go.</p>
<h2><br>
</h2>
<h2>The Basics of MX2 Inputs and Outputs<br>
</h2>
<p>Before we go any further, let’s describe how the MX2 inputs work.&nbsp; As
 we described earlier, there are two I/O lines and one GND line per 
input connector, this means there is no 5V signal!&nbsp; In fact, when an 
input is engaged in the MX2 firmware, it is immediately “pulled high” at
 20K of resistance.&nbsp; This means that the MX2 will read a 5V signal off 
that input as long as the input is left unconnected.&nbsp; Thus, to trigger 
the input, you will need to connect the GND signal to the input you wish
 to trigger.&nbsp; This allows you to wire switches and other passive devices
 easily without needing a power source.</p>
<p>Only <em>Ext 1</em> inputs are available for triggering actions on the MX2.</p>
<p>As the internal pull-up resistors are 20K Ohms, you must not exceed 
19K of resistance in your cabling, otherwise the signal will not be 
recognized.&nbsp; Limit yourself to under 20′ of 20gg wiring.</p>
<p>All <em>Ext 1</em> inputs are automatically de-bounced for you, so 
you can use analog switches without having to build complicated 
de-bouncing circuitry.</p>
<p><strong>Under no circumstances should you ever send a positive signal
 (+V) down any Ext I/O line!&nbsp; Doing so may permanently damage your MX2!</strong></p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>As for outputs, each input port may instead be converted to outputs, 
to trigger external devices like relays, lights, etc. As with inputs, 
the behavior of triggering an output is to connect the given output to 
the common GND signal. <br>
</p>
<p><strong><br>
</strong></p>
<h2>Actions Available Based On Inputs</h2><br>
Each individual input has the following actions which can be associated with it:<br>
<ul>
 <li>Stop</li>
 <li>Start</li>
 <li>Toggle</li>
 <li>Remote Intervalometer</li>
</ul>
<h2><br>
</h2>
<h2>Actions Available for Outputs</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Trigger before shot</li>
 <li>Trigger after shot</li>
 <li>Trigger before and after shot</li>
</ul>The trigger times are shared between both outputs if they are configured to trigger at the same time.<br>
<br>
<h2>Dynamic Perception Multi-Function Switch Blocks</h2>The <a href="http://dynamicperception.com/products/multi-function-switch-block">Multi-Function Switch Blocks</a> <span class="print-footnote">[6]</span>
 provide a quick and easy way to interact with the inputs on the MX2. 
They can be used either as limit switches, or as remote toggles.&nbsp; 
For information about how to configure the MX2 to work with the switch 
blocks in a particular role, see the sections below.<br>
<br>
<h2>Creating Limit Switches</h2>
<p>For limit switches, the best type to use are momentary micro switches
 with a lever, either SPST (normally open), or SPDT (choose between 
normally open and normally closed).&nbsp; These switches are easily 
sourced 
cheaply, and work very well as limit switches.&nbsp; It is important to 
use the correct kind of switch for the correct application: the 
"lever-style" limit switches that have an arm are designed to be placed 
in a fixed position and the moving object should trip them by moving 
into them; if you want to place your switches on your cart - use a 
plunger-style switch instead.<br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To wire up your limit switch, connect the 
GND lead from your cable (the Sleeve of the TRS connector) to the 
Normally Open connector on the switch, and connect either the Ring 
(Input 1 in the MX2 firmware) or the Tip (Input 2 in the MX2 firmware) 
to the signal connector.&nbsp;&nbsp; Leave the normally closed contact 
unconnected!&nbsp; Now, when the switch is depressed, the input will be 
connected to the GND signal, and the MX2 will recognize it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When using limit switches on your cart, you
 should generally have one on each side of the cart, to stop it from 
moving too far in either direction.&nbsp; You can use the same input for both
 switches to save yourself an input on the MX2, just splice in some 
extra wires.&nbsp; The best place to locate your switches are on the cart its
 self, either glued or fastened to the edges such that the belt clamps 
trip the switches.&nbsp; By placing them on the cart, you will reduce the 
amount of wiring you need to use.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Remember that the Ring is Input 1 in the MX2 firmware and the Tip is Input 2 in the MX2 firmware.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>NOTE: The limit switch function will only work when the program is ‘on’, do NOT rely on limit switches in <em>manual motor</em> control!&nbsp; The input toggles do not apply to <em>manual motor</em> control and you must prevent over-running the belt clips by releasing the direction button before you hit them.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>To configure the firmware to recognize your input as a limit switch:</strong></p>
<ol>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Enter]</span> to enter the main menu</li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Down]</span> to select <strong>Settings</strong> and press<span style="color: #3366ff;"> [Enter]</span></li>

 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Up]</span> or<span style="color: #3366ff;"> [Down]</span> to set the value to <em><strong>Stop</strong></em></li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Enter]</span> to save or <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Right]</span> to abort</li>
</ol>
<h2>Creating Your Own Remote Toggle Switch</h2>
<p>You can create your own toggle switch to start and stop the program 
from running when you press a remote button.&nbsp; Just like with limit 
switches above, we’ll use a TRS cable to connect a momentary switch to 
the MX2.&nbsp; For this purpose, it is better to use an SPST Momentary 
Pushbutton (normally open) which are very easy to source and 
inexpensive.&nbsp; Connect one of the leads to one of the input conductors 
and the other to GND.&nbsp; Once you have configured the firmware correctly, 
every time you press the switch, the program will start if it is 
stopped, or stop if it is started.</p>
<p>Some wired remotes for cameras that have a 2.5mm TRS connector may 
work fine with the MX2, as long as they are not powered (no battery).&nbsp; 
You may have to experiment to see which input is triggered when using 
it.</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">Controlling Inexpensive Telescope Heads</h1>
  
<div class="post">          
            

<p>The MX2 controller is capable of controlling a low-cost 
motorized telescope head, in addition to its two axes of DC motor 
control.  This functionality can be used to quickly and easily add pan 
and tilt control to your MoCo project at a very low cost.  The following
 telescope mounts are supported:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Acuter Merlin</li>
 <li>Merlin SynScan AZ GoTo</li>
 <li>Orion Teletrack</li>
 <li>Skywatcher Multifunction</li>
 <li>Celestron Skywatcher ('Backpacker')<br>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll notice that the only difference between these mounts is the 
name brand and the hand-controller on it.&nbsp; You do not need to buy the 
GoTo models, as the extra cost will be unrealized (the MX2 replaces the 
hand-controller when used with the MX2 or the Stage Zero).&nbsp; Please note 
that these are the only officially supported telescope mounts.&nbsp; Other 
models produced by Synta or the other name brands they market under <em>may work</em>
 but have not been tested, and even if they do support the same 
protocol, they may have wildly different wiring requirements that may 
make them incompatible.&nbsp; From here on out, we will refer to these heads 
collectively as <em>Merlin</em>.</p>
<h2>How The Merlin Integration Works</h2>
<p>The MX2 controller is capable of pretending to be the hand-controller
 shipped with the telescope head.&nbsp; It is used in place of the original 
hand controller. A special connector cable is made (instructions below),
 and is used to connect the <em>EXT 0</em> port on the MX2 to the <em>HC</em>
 port on the Merlin.&nbsp; Once the telescope functions have been enabled in 
the MX2 firmware, you will now have a new manual control option labeled 
‘Scope’, and a second home screen will be available allowing you to 
specify the movement speeds or distances for the pan and tilt axes 
during program execution.</p>
<p>The MX2 communicates with the Merlin via a specially constructed 
cable, and uses a textual serial protocol to transmit and receive 
information from the Merlin mount.</p>
<p>Much of the integration work is based on the great work done by <a href="http://www.guzzzt.com/" target="_blank">Gustav Evertsson</a> <span class="print-footnote">[7]</span> on his <a href="http://www.gigapixel.nu/info_project.php" target="_blank">Gigapixel Photo Rig</a> <span class="print-footnote">[8]</span> and the <a href="http://www.papywizard.org/" target="_blank">Papywizard</a> <span class="print-footnote">[9]</span>
 group where they have been working with the Merlin heads for some 
time.&nbsp; The MX2 firmware requires a modified version of Gustav’s 
MerlinMount library that enables greater control of the head, and can be
 downloaded from<a href="http://openmoco.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/openmoco/Arduino/Libraries/MerlinMount/trunk/" target="_blank"> OpenMoCo.org’s SVN repository</a> <span class="print-footnote">[10]</span>.</p>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>It goes without saying, there are always some limitations, and the Merlin control has a few:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Ramping/feathering is not supported for the Merlin axes</li>
 <li>You cannot upload firmware with the Merlin cable connected to the MX2</li>
 <li>You must have the Merlin powered on and connected before attempting 
to use any Merlin-related features, or the MX2 will lockup and require a
 power cycle before responding</li>
 <li>You are limited to 1/10th of a degree speed/motion inputs for the Merlin head</li>
 <li>The Merlin head does not support <em>Calculated Interleave</em> mode, only <em>Fixed Interleave</em> and <em>Continuous</em> <a href="http://dynamicperception.com/content/choosing-your-motion-mode">motion modes</a> <span class="print-footnote">[2]</span> are supported.</li>
 <li>You cannot perform any other Serial communications with the MX2 via the USB port when the Merlin cable is connected</li>
 <li>You cannot use the camera port on the Merlin</li>
 <li>The Merlin requires its own 12V power supply
<ul>
 <li>You can, however, use a Y-adapter for the 2.1mm power cable provided for the MX2</li>
 <li>You can also run the Merlin off of AA batteries</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Running on USB Power Alone</h2>
<p>If you wish to only control the Merlin and your camera with the MX2, 
and not control other DC motors via the motor ports, you may power the 
MX2 off of five volts via the USB cable.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Merlin will still need 
its own power supply, either via AA batteries or a 12V DC feed to the 
Merlin’s power input port.</p>
<h2>Creating an Adapter Cable</h2>
<p>To communicate with the Merlin head, you will need to create a simple cable to connect the Merlin to the MX2.&nbsp; See <a href="http://dynamicperception.com/content/create-merlin-communication-cable">Creating a Merlin Communication Cable</a> <span class="print-footnote">[11]</span> for instructions.</p>
<p>After you have created the cable, use it to connect EXT0 with the HC port on the Merlin.</p>
<h2>Enabling Scope Control</h2>
<p>To be able to control the Merlin via the MX2, you must enable the 
scope control in the firmware.&nbsp; This setting is found under the global 
settings menu.</p>
<p><strong>To enable <em>Scope Control</em></strong>:</p>
<ol>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Enter] </span>to enter the main menu</li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Down] </span>to select <strong>Settings </strong>and press <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Enter]</span></li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Down]</span> to select <strong>Scope </strong>and press<span style="color: #3366ff;"> [Enter]</span></li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Up]</span> or<span style="color: #3366ff;"> [Down]</span> and choose&nbsp; <em><strong>On</strong></em></li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Enter]</span> to save or<span style="color: #3366ff;"> [Right]</span> to abort</li>
</ol>
<h2>Manually Positioning the Merlin</h2>
<p>Once you have enabled scope control, you will now have a new option available in the <em>manual control</em> screen labeled <em>scope</em>.&nbsp; This option enables you to control both axes of the Merlin from a single screen.</p>
<p>Inside the <em>scope</em> manual control screen, use <span style="color: #3366ff;">[left]</span> to cause the pan (yaw) axis to start moving left, and<span style="color: #3366ff;"> [right]</span> to cause the pan axis to start moving right.&nbsp; Pressing either button again will cause the motion to stop.&nbsp;<span style="color: #3366ff;"> [up]</span> and <span style="color: #3366ff;">[down]</span> cause the tilt (pitch) axis to move either up or down, again, pressing either a second time will stop movement.</p>
<p>Press <span style="color: #3366ff;">[enter]</span> to exit this screen and return to the main manual control screen.</p>
<p><em>You can configure the speeds at which the pan and tilt axes move 
in the scope manual control screen by accessing the Main Menu-&gt;Scope 
menu, and configuring the desired manual speed, from 0.1 deg/minute, to 
1,440 deg/minute.</em></p>
<p><strong>Actions:</strong></p>
<ol>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Enter]</span> to enter the main menu</li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Down]</span> to select <strong>Manual</strong>and press<span style="color: #3366ff;"> [Enter]</span></li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Down]</span> to select <strong>Scope</strong>, and press <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Enter]</span></li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Up]</span>,<span style="color: #3366ff;"> [Down]</span>, <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Left]</span>, and <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Right]</span> to position the Merlin</li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Enter]</span> to exit the manual control screen</li>
 <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">[Right] </span>to return to the main menu</li>
</ol>
<h2>Configuring the Merlin for Use During a Shot</h2>
<p>Once you have enabled <em>scope control</em> in the MX2 firmware, you
 will now have an additional home screen available.&nbsp; To access the 
additional home screen, simply press <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Up]</span> on the home screen with no items selected, it will switch to a new screen that looks like the following:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 30px;">================</pre>
<pre style="padding-left: 30px;">Off&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scope</pre>
<pre style="padding-left: 30px;">R0.0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; U0.0</pre>
<pre style="padding-left: 30px;">================</pre>
<p>This is the scope control screen.&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the normal home screen, you can use <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Right]</span> and<span style="color: #3366ff;"> [Left]</span>
 to select an item to edit, the On/Off control works just as with the 
normal home screen, starting or stopping the current shot program.&nbsp; The 
pan axis is displayed first, and then the tilt axis, these values can be
 modified just like the normal axis controls on the normal home screen.&nbsp;
 You can select R for right or L for left for pan, or U for up and D for
 down for the tilt axis.</p>
<p>Distance values are input in tenths of degrees from 0.1 to 360.&nbsp; When in <em>continuous motion</em> mode these values indicate how many degrees to move per minute, whereas in <em>interleaved</em>
 mode, these values indicate how many degrees to move between each 
shot.&nbsp; Scope motion control always inherits from the global motion 
control mode with one caveat: when in <em>interleaved </em>mode, the 
Merlin will only operate in Fixed SMS, even no other axis is set to 
fixed SMS.&nbsp; Additionally, ramping is not supported for the Merlin head 
at this time.</p>
<p>To exit the scope control screen, simply press <span style="color: #3366ff;">[Up]</span>
 again with no values currently selected for editing.&nbsp; You may switch 
back and forth between these home screens while the program is executing
 without issue.</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">Create a Merlin Communication Cable</h1>
  
<div class="post">          
            

<p>To use the Merlin head with the MX2 controller, you will 
need to make a simple cable to connect the two.&nbsp; This cable can be made 
in a few minutes with a few dollars worth of parts – many of which you 
may already have laying around.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p><strong>For those that want to communicate with their telescope head, but do not want to take the risk of making their own cable, the <a href="http://dynamicperception.com/products/merlin-adapter-kit-mx2">Merlin Adapter Kit</a> <span class="print-footnote">[12]</span> provides a ready-to-use adapter that works right out of the box.</strong></p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>To create a cable, you will need the following parts:</p>
<ul>
 <li>1x RJ-12 (US Telephone) cable</li>
 <li>1x 2.5mm TRS cable (or a TRS male plug with solder cups)</li>
 <li>2x 220 Ohm resistors</li>
 <li>Heat-shrink tubing or electrical tape</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1:</strong> Cut the RJ-12 cable to the desired length, and 
the same for  the TRS cable.&nbsp; A good length is about 14″ if you mount 
the MX2 on the  Stage Zero cart, or 6′ if you intend to use the Merlin 
as a stand-alone  device with the MX2.&nbsp; You’ll notice that the RJ-12 
cable has the wires  twisted, such that the two plug sides of it have a 
different order of  wires.&nbsp; Looking at the connector from the top, such 
that the retaining  clip is facing upwards, choose the side that has the
 Black to the far  left and the Yellow to the far right.&nbsp; (If your cable
 uses different  colors, use the colors matching the far left and far 
right instead of  Black and Yellow.) Strip off a few inches of the 
protective coating  covering the RJ-12 cable, and cut away the two 
center leads (usually red  and green). Strip off the protective coating 
from the Black and Yellow  conductors for about an inch.&nbsp; It will be 
easiest to construct the cable  neatly to cut the Black conductor such 
that it is about 3/4″ longer  than the Yellow conductor.</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://dynamicperception.com/images/tutorials/merlincable/merlin1.png"><img title="RJ-12" src="35_files/merlin1.png" alt="" width="400" height="264"></a> <span class="print-footnote">[13]</span> <a href="http://dynamicperception.com/images/tutorials/merlincable/merlin2.png"><img title="Cut RJ-12 cable" src="35_files/merlin2.png" alt="" width="400" height="264"></a> <span class="print-footnote">[14]</span></p>
<p><strong>2:</strong> Cut the TRS cable to length and strip away the 
protective  coating for a few inches.&nbsp; Isolate the Tip, Ring, and Sleeve
 conductors  (Tip is usually Red, Ring is usually White, and Sleeve will
 often have  no sheathing, and be bare wire strands.) – strip off the 
protective  coating of each conductor back to an inch or so.</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://dynamicperception.com/images/tutorials/merlincable/merlin3.png"><img title="strip TRS cable" src="35_files/merlin3.png" alt="" width="400" height="264"></a> <span class="print-footnote">[15]</span></p>
<p><strong>3:</strong> Prepare the 2 220 Ohm resistors.&nbsp; Trim one lead from each down to about 1/3″ length.</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://dynamicperception.com/images/tutorials/merlincable/merlin4.png"><img title="prepare resistors" src="35_files/merlin4.png" alt="" width="400" height="264"></a> <span class="print-footnote">[16]</span></p>
<p><strong>4:</strong> If you are using heat-shrink tubing to protect 
your cable,  first slip a large diameter piece (1/4″), a few inches in 
length down  the RJ-12 cable you are using.</p>
<p><strong>5:</strong> Solder one of the resistors onto either the Tip 
or Ring of  the TRS cable, such that the short end is soldered to the 
conductor.&nbsp;  Place a piece of 1/8″ heat-shrink tubing over this lead 
such that the  resistor its self, and the conductor from the TRS&nbsp; cable 
are completely  covered, and heat to protect it.&nbsp; You do not need to 
worry about the  other lead from the resistor.&nbsp; Repeat this step with 
the second resistor  and the other lead from the TRS cable.</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://dynamicperception.com/images/tutorials/merlincable/merlin5.png"><img title="solder resistor" src="35_files/merlin5.png" alt="" width="400" height="264"></a> <span class="print-footnote">[17]</span> <a href="http://dynamicperception.com/images/tutorials/merlincable/merlin6.png"><img title="heat shrink" src="35_files/merlin6.png" alt="" width="400" height="264"></a> <span class="print-footnote">[18]</span> <a href="http://dynamicperception.com/images/tutorials/merlincable/merlin7.png"><img title="repeat for remaining resistor+lead" src="35_files/merlin7.png" alt="" width="400" height="264"></a> <span class="print-footnote">[19]</span></p>
<p><strong>6:</strong> Twist both long leads of the resistor together, and solder to the Yellow conductor from the RJ-12 cable.</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://dynamicperception.com/images/tutorials/merlincable/merlin8.png"><img title="solder resistors together with signal line" src="35_files/merlin8.png" alt="" width="400" height="264"></a> <span class="print-footnote">[20]</span></p>
<p><strong>7:</strong> Solder together the Black conductor from the RJ-12 jack and the Sleeve conductor from the TRS cable.</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://dynamicperception.com/images/tutorials/merlincable/merlin9.png"><img title="Solder ground lines together" src="35_files/merlin9.png" alt="" width="400" height="264"></a> <span class="print-footnote">[21]</span></p>
<p><strong>8:</strong> Slide the large diameter heat-shrink into position, and heat it to protect the new cable connection.</p>
<p>You now have a cable ready to use to control the Merlin!</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">Upgrading the MX2 Firmware</h1>
  
<div class="post">          
            

<p>The MX2 is designed to be updated with new firmware.&nbsp; You
 can create your own, or use any newer version put out by us (or someone
 else!).&nbsp;&nbsp; If you’re creating your own firmware or want to modify the 
existing firmware, you’ll need to be comfortable with the Arduino IDE, 
and then just compile and upload the <a href="http://openmoco.org/node/213" target="_blank">latest firmware</a> <span class="print-footnote">[22]</span> yourself in the Arduino IDE.</p>
<p>However, we also provide a graphical firmware update utility that 
makes it even easier if you don’t want to deal with anything other than 
just installing the latest firmware.</p>
<h2>MX2 Firmware Update Utility</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://dynamicperception.com/software/mx2-firmware-update-utility">MX2 Firmware Update Utility</a> <span class="print-footnote">[23]</span> is a simple GUI built in <a href="http://processing.org/" target="_blank">Processing</a> <span class="print-footnote">[24]</span>
 that lets you update to the latest firmware with just a few clicks.&nbsp; It
 handles all of the messy bits for you, making it easy to update in just
 a few minutes without any hassles.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://dynamicperception.com/software/mx2-firmware-update-utility">MX2 Firmware Update Utility</a> <span class="print-footnote">[23]</span> only supports Windows, for more requirements see the <a href="http://dynamicperception.com/software/mx2-firmware-update-utility?quicktabs_softinfotab=2#quicktabs-softinfotab">System Requirements</a> <span class="print-footnote">[25]</span> for it.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<h3>Using the Firmware Update Utility</h3>
<p>After you’ve downloaded the binary package, uncompress it and extract to any folder on your local hard drive.</p>
<p><strong><em>Please note: at this time, the MX2Uploader does not 
support running in a directory with a space in its name (such as ‘My 
Documents’, etc.).&nbsp; Please place it in a directory that does not include
 spaces, e.g.: c:\mx2hex.<br>
</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Always make sure that you connect the MX2 to your computer via the USB cable before running the update utility.</em></p>
<p>Open the folder where you extracted the update utility in your file browser and click on the application named ‘MX2Uploader’.</p>
<p>When the update utility runs, you will be greeted with this screen:</p>
<p align="center"><img class="aligncenter" title="Firmware Update Utility Main Screen" src="35_files/screen1.png" alt="" width="400" height="408"></p>
<p>Choose the correct Version you want to upgrade/downgrade to and the COM Port that your MX2 is on.</p>
<p>Once you press the ‘Upload’ button, the updating process will begin, and an upload in progress indicator will be displayed.</p>
<p align="center"><img class="aligncenter" title="Firmware Update Utility Uploading" src="35_files/screen2.png" alt="" width="400" height="404"></p>
<p>It may take up to a few minutes to upload the new firmware.&nbsp; Your MX2
 may display strange information on the LCD during this process.</p>
<p>After the upload is successfully completed, the utility will display an upload complete indicator:</p>
<p align="center"><img class="aligncenter" title="Firmware Update Utility Complete" src="35_files/screen3.png" alt="" width="400" height="404"></p>
<p>You are now ready to run your new firmware!</p>
<h3>Known Problems</h3>
